# bas2abc
GWBasic to ABC notation converter

Using a very old Basic program we wrote many years back (about 1990 ?) 
The R-Script parses the old BAS files, and comes up with an ABC file for each tune in the BAS file.

Using the online https://zn-live.zupfnoter.de/ to test the ABC notation.
The output of the different abc files is also saved in this repo, for applying manual fixes where required.
